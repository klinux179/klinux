# klinux
This project is the klinux(Kaktusz(cactus) Linux). The aim of the project is to create a stable and minimalist operating system called Klinux, including a console version and a Klinux server as well.

Klinux:
It will be a minimalist but good made os based on linux that can operate very good with the Klinux server. People can use it on everything(that has support for it) for everyday task like text editing coding and more.

Klinux console:
It will be a linux based os too that has support for retro games like GameBoy, GameBoy color and GameBoy advance. The project also provide games for it and custom mades to. It will not work with the Klinux server.

Klinux server:
It's a litle server that can handle small networks and bigs too, but only locale networks. It has it's own configuration panel so you don't have to use terminal to confgurate it, only for things that you installed, these are the things it will do:
-Active Directory
-Email server
-SSH server
-DNS server
